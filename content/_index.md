<b> Hi! My name is Alex Borelli </b> and I am a senior Sport Analytics major & Economics and Sport Management minor at [__Syracuse University__](https://www.syracuse.edu/). I have spent last summer as an Analytics Intern at [__Major League Baseball (MLB)__](https://www.mlb.com/) and have past data analysis & database management internship experiences with [__SBRnet__](https://sportsmarketanalytics.com/home.aspx?rs=nf) and [__Syracuse Football__](https://cuse.com/sports/football). 

I have a passion for using numbers and data to find solutions to questions, specifically in the sports world. As an aspiring data scientist, I like to get my hands dirty in data in order to solve problems with statistical, mathematical, and data techniques. I enjoy learning by doing and using my curiosity to expand my knowledge in the field through various statistical and mathematical approaches.

Through my education thus far at Syracuse, I have spent a couple of semesters as a research assistant using optimization techniques for DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) lineups in order to maximize profits. I also founded and currently serve as vice president of the Syracuse University Fantasy Sports Club, a community for SU students to discuss fantasy sports insight and recommendations amongst one another.
