<b> Hi there! I'm Alex Borelli </b>, a Data Analyst at [__Major League Baseball__](https://www.mlb.com/) and Master of Science Data Science student at [__Fordham University__](https://www.fordham.edu/). I graduated from [Syracuse University__](https://www.syracuse.edu/) in May of 2023 with summa cum laude honors, holding a Bachelor's degree in Sport Analytics complemented with minors in Economics and Sport Management.

In addition to my current role, I previously interned as an Analytics Intern at [__Major League Baseball (MLB)__](https://www.mlb.com/) in their Strategy & Development department, gaining hands-on experience in leveraging data to extract insights and inform data-driven decisions on MLB products and user consumption. I've also honed my data analysis and database management skills through internships with [__SBRnet__](https://sportsmarketanalytics.com/home.aspx?rs=nf) and [__Syracuse Football__](https://cuse.com/sports/football).

My true passion lies in unraveling complex challenges through the lens of data science. As a data scientist, I thrive on delving into datasets to uncover patterns, apply statistical methods, and create meaningful solutions. I embrace a hands-on learning approach, consistently exploring new statistical and mathematical techniques to broaden my skillset.

During my academic journey, I've actively engaged in research, specifically through participating in various competitions. I finished 2nd overall amongst 150 undergraduate and graduate students at the [__AXS National Collegiate Sport Analytics Competition__](https://news.syr.edu/blog/2023/03/01/falk-college-sport-analytics-students-continue-success-at-national-competitions/) and led my team to a 1st overall finish in the game analytics division last spring.

I'm always eager to connect and collaborate. Feel free to reach out via email at [__aborelli7@fordham.edu__](aborelli7@fordham.edu) or explore some of my personal and professional endeavors on the Research tab.
